fiki
====

The File based Wiki

Description
---
This project aimed to be just a simple container to link "externals" html pages.
The target for us was to collect all asciidoc generated pages (using the
Raskiidoc project https://github.com/llicour/raskiidoc) and have an easy
template to collect, show and browse all the resource.

For that reason we based the "Wiki" (Fiki) on file system. It looks in the data
folder looking for arguments to display (a fiki argument is a folder); inside
each arguments you can have as many html files as you want.
Fiki will read the '<title>' tag of any page and display it on the Fiki homepage
(inside the correct argument).

Arguments configuration
---
For any arguments you can create a YAML file to add information for your
arguments.
By default the folder name is shown on the page as argument name, but, creating
inside the argument folder a file named ``metadata.yaml`` allow you to add:

title: the name of the argument to show (shown despite of folder name)
description: argument content description

Example yaml file:
```yaml
---
title: My first argument
description: my argument description
```

Requirements
---
To use the Arguments description Yaml file, you should install the PHP Yaml
librery:

php-pecl-yaml : Support for YAML 1.1 serialization using the LibYAML
