The File based Wiki

Description
---
This project aimed to be just a simple container to link "externals" html pages.
The target for us was to collect all asciidoc generated pages (using the
Raskiidoc project https://github.com/llicour/raskiidoc) and have an easy
template to collect, show and browse all the resource.

For that reason we based the "Wiki" (Fiki) on file system. It looks in the data
folder looking for arguments to display (a fiki argument is a folder); inside
each arguments you can have as many html files as you want.
Fiki will read the '<title>' tag of any page and display it on the Fiki homepage
(inside the correct argument).


FikiBootstrap Backend for Asciidoc Build
---

armony in your wiki. The backend project is located on:

In Dev

Actually I'm working on:
* Argument metadata file to personalize the way an argument will be displayed on Fiki
  page (for example the name and a little description/logo)

* Order on the page: a way to order projetct and file inside the project on the
  fiki page
